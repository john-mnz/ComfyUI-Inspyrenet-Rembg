# ComfyUI-Inspyrenet-Rembg
[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) node for background removal, implementing [InSPyReNet](https://github.com/plemeri/InSPyReNet)
</br></br>

I've tested a lot of different AI rembg methods (BRIA - U2Net - IsNet - SAM - OPEN RMBG, ...) but in all of my tests InSPyReNet was always ON A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL!

The cherry on top is that [InSPyReNet](https://github.com/plemeri/InSPyReNet) has MIT License which allows for Commercial use (for example BRIA does not allow Commercial use to my knowledge)

Check the Licenses for yourself I will not be held accountable :)

## Updates

Added an advanced node that supports threshold

## Features

Superior rembg quality compared to other methods (just give it a try!)

Can take batch of images as input

Optimized for image batch to be the fastest rembg node (perfect for video frames)

Outputs both the image and the corresponding mask

Shows the progress in terminal


## Installation 

### Simple way:

search for  `ComfyUI-Inspyrenet-Rembg` in ComfyUI-Manager and hit install.

Done!

### Manual:

1. Go to your `custom_nodes` folder in ComfyUI, open the terminal and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/john-mnz/ComfyUI-Inspyrenet-Rembg.git
```

2. To install requirements, run the following commands:

```
cd ComfyUI-Inspyrenet-Rembg
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Done!

It downloads the pretrained model automatically at first use

You can also manually download the model to `comfyui/models/transparent-background` (suggest downloading a base)

  [base](https://github.com/plemeri/transparent-background/releases/download/1.2.12/ckpt_base.pth)
  
  [fast](https://github.com/plemeri/transparent-background/releases/download/1.2.12/ckpt_fast.pth)
  
  [base-nightly](https://github.com/plemeri/transparent-background/releases/download/1.2.12/ckpt_base_nightly.pth)

## note 
If torchscript_jif is set to on, it will trace model with pytorch built-in torchscript JIT compiler. May cause delay in initialization, but reduces inference time and gpu memory usage.

## basic workflow 

download this file and drag and drop it into your comfyui as basic workflow:
